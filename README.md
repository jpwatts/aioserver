# Example `asyncio` server from PyTexas 2015

This is an example project from [our tutorial at at PyTexas 2015](https://www.pytexas.org/2015/talk/49).

  * [Slides](http://static.joelwatts.net/asyncio-pytexas-2015/slides.pdf)

I also presented the slides in [my talk](https://www.pytexas.org/2015/talk/50).

## Installation

    $ python3 -m pip install -e /path/to/aioserver

Installation creates an `aioserver` console entry point.

## Usage

    $ aioserver

I haven't tested this on Python > 3.5, but I'd expect it to keep working.
